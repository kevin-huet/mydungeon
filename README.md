What is that ?

MyDungeon is a web application bringing some functionality and tools to World of Warcraft.

But what are these features?
If you are a World of Warcraft player, you probably need to be familiar with dungeons and more specifically mythics + dungeons.
The goal is to provide players with a group search system outside of the game, in order to find them a fixed group with which they can progress.
Thanks to a future addon that I am developing, there will also be the possibility to rate a person in the game ONLY after participating in a dungeon with him, via keywords or rated categories. The goal of this is to avoid toxicity and people having boosted their raider.io score.

The latter works using the API of Blizzard and Raider.io.

In terms of the technologies used around this project, I use the Symfony 5 framework, Jquery, Materialize, Docker and MariaDB
